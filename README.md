# JavaCheckout
Mock Java program to simulate a stores checkout system.

itemlist.txt is required to be in the same folder as StoreCheckout.java for the items to be added.
In order to change the catalog items, edit the "itemlist.txt" file using whichever items you would like, ensure proper format is followed or it will not work (name - description - price).
